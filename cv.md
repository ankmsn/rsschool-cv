# **Andrii Khomyshyn**

## Junior Frontend Developer

![my photo](photo.jpg/)


I study Frontend development: JavaScript, HTML, CSS. I also have over 10 years of experience as a graphic designer: branding, advertasing, vector, raster, creating patterns, icons, graphic elements and illustrations.
I always tried to structure, streamline and automate the process: actions, scripts.  
 My dream is to join a team with which I will participate in projects of global importance, combining previous experience, current and newly acquired knowledge.  
My personal qualities are organization, responsibility, attention to detail. Project timing and meeting deadlines.  
 Always improve existing skills and gain additional knowledge.
